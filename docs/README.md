# LUDIGEEKS METHOD

## OBJECTIVES

Ludigeeks aims to educate and raise awareness among the public through fun "hands on" activities about protecting individuals in the digital world.

## FORMAT

Ludigeeks is structured as **thematic workshops**, divided into **four phases**:

### 1. **Make**  
This phase engages participants in actively **creating elements or a context** to immerse themselves in the activity. The goal is to make them **co-creators** of the experience while embedding a **cybersecurity challenge** within their creation.

### 2. **Challenge**  
The challenge phase introduces or **triggers a cybersecurity issue** within what participants have created, prompting them to **identify the problem**.

### 3. **Improvement/Evolution**  
Once the cybersecurity issue is identified, this phase encourages participants to **work towards solving the problem themselves**. They explore different ways to improve or **enhance their initial creation** in response to the challenge.

### 4. **Debate**  
The debate phase **broadens the discussion** on the encountered cybersecurity problem, linking it to **real-world scenarios** where adopting the right reflexes can **prevent digital threats**.  

This phase also allows participants to **share experiences**, discuss potential risks they might face, and **gather ideas** for future workshops.

## Guidelines

### 1. Everyone can own the material
Ludigeeks aims to use as much as possible basic material that everyone can own with the cheapest price possible (ideal is free of charge).

### 2. Make it touchable
Ludigeeks aims to use material that can be touched and manipulated like 3d printed objects, toys, papers... as much as possible to make it more accessible.

### 3. Make it visual
Ludigeeks aims to make things as much as possible visual to make it more accessible for everyone.

### 4. Make it simple to understand
Ludigeeks aims to make things as muh as possible easy to understand for anyone who can read, write, count without any other background.

## OBJECTIVES

- What activity do you want to set up? *(Scavenger hunt, Olympics, cabaret, rally, etc.)*  
- Why do you want to set up this activity? *(Getting to know the group, discovering the area, etc.)*

- How will you decorate the space? Does it fit your theme?  
- How will you organize the space? Who will set up the stations and equipment?  
- Have you accounted for travel time during the activity? Are travel areas safe and marked?  
- What costumes do you need? Who will prepare them? What about music, lighting, etc.?  

## RECEPTION

- How will you efficiently gather the participants? *(A lead facilitator? Non-costumed facilitators guiding participants before joining the activity?)*  
- How will you form, balance, and position teams, audience, and facilitators to ensure everyone can see, understand, and participate?  
- Are meeting time and location details clear and visible?  
- Stay in character and maintain immersion *(One game character can represent authority for participants).*

- How will you supervise and energize participants, and acknowledge achievements? *(Score updates, rallying chants, encouragement.)*  
- How will you adapt if the game does not engage participants? *(Avoid improvisation, opt for adaptation.)*  
- How will you adjust if the weather is unfavorable?  

## RHYTHM

- Does your activity respect the pace of the participants and the group?  
- Does it fit well within the intensity curve of the day or the overall event?  
- Does the activity itself have a well-managed intensity curve?  
- What transitions will you use between different stages of the activity?  
- What rest and break periods do you plan during the activity?  

## FACILITATION

- What is the storyline of your activity? Does it align with your theme?  
- How will you integrate your theme throughout all stages of the activity? *(Awareness, setup, characters, reception, progress, conclusion.)*  
- How will you maintain immersion? *(Each person should stay in character while remembering their role as a facilitator.)*  

## CONCLUSION

- How will you anticipate the end of the activity? *(Participants should know in advance when it ends.)*  
- How long will your activity last? *(Guidelines:  
# Recommended Activity Duration by Age Group

| **Age Group**  | **Recommended Activity Duration** | **Notes** |
|---------------|--------------------------------|---------|
| **Ages 3-5**  | **20-40 minutes**  | Short and interactive. Use storytelling, movement, and hands-on activities. Break every **10-15 min**. |
| **Ages 6-9**  | **40-60 minutes**  | Can sustain structured activities but need variety. Breaks every **20-30 min**. |
| **Ages 10-12** | **60-75 minutes**  | Stronger focus, but still need engagement shifts. Break every **30-45 min**. |
| **Ages 13-15** | **75-90 minutes**  | Capable of deeper focus but need engaging formats (games, discussions, challenges). Break every **45 min**. |
| **Ages 16-18** | **90-120 minutes**  | More autonomy and problem-solving ability. Can handle long activities but benefit from a **break every 45-60 min**. |
| **Ages 19-25** | **1.5-2.5 hours**  | Optimal for workshops, training, debates, or immersive projects. **Breaks every 60-75 min**. |
| **Ages 26-39** | **2-3 hours**  | Can sustain engagement for structured learning or problem-solving sessions. **Breaks every 60-75 min**. |
| **Ages 40-55** | **1.5-2.5 hours**  | Prefer structured sessions but need **more frequent breaks (every 45-60 min)**. |
| **Ages 55+**   | **1-2 hours**  | Lower endurance for long sessions. Keep activities interactive with breaks **every 30-45 min**. |

## Key Considerations:
✅ **Younger participants need shorter, engaging activities with frequent breaks.**  
✅ **Teenagers and young adults benefit from interactive formats and deeper discussions.**  
✅ **Adults (30-55) can focus for long periods but need structured breaks.**  
✅ **Older adults (55+) require shorter, interactive sessions to maintain focus.**  
✅ **For mixed-age groups, plan adaptable activities with flexible timing.**

- How will you wrap up the activity? *(Announcing scores, winners, distributing rewards, etc.)*  
- How will you ensure a smooth transition back to a calm state? *(Singing, music, relaxation, etc.)*  

## FEEDBACK

- How do you gather feedback from participants in live to get hot information?
- How do you keep notes from the feeback ?
- How will gather cold feedback ? (you can recommend to participants to use https://www.wocsa.org/pages/contact.php through qr code or other solution.)

## CLEANUP

- How will you organize the cleanup and storage of stations and materials? *(Decorations, props, costumes, lighting, etc.)* Who is responsible?  
- Will participants help? If so, how? *(Cleanup should not disrupt or overshadow the end of the activity.)*  

## ANALYSIS

- Were the objectives met? *(Fully or partially?)*  
- As a team, identify the strengths of the activity and areas for improvement.  
- Keep written records for future reference and learning.
