## 🏗️ Activity Flow

### **1️⃣ Creating the Secret Box: Programming**
- The facilitator distributes the **explanatory sheets**.  
- Participants use the provided Scratch program to **create their Secret Box**.  
- Once completed, participants **test their program**.  
- When everyone has tested their Secret Box, the facilitator asks them to **reset their program** and **put it in full-screen mode**.

---

### **2️⃣ Hacker Phase**
- Participants **switch places** to test someone else’s Secret Box.  
- The facilitator asks participants to **orally discuss** ways to "break" the program.  
- The facilitator introduces the **concept of hacking** and explains that participants will now **play the role of hackers**.  
- Participants attempt to **bypass security** by exiting full-screen mode and reading the **stored password inside the Scratch program**.

---

### **3️⃣ Discussion Round #1**
- Participants reflect on their experience.  
- The facilitator asks guiding questions, such as:  
  - *How do you feel about this experience?*  
  - *Do you think your secret is safe?*  

---

### **4️⃣ Data Protection**
- Participants realize that **their secret is not secure**, so they are introduced to a **more secure version** of the program.  
- The facilitator distributes **updated explanatory sheets**.  
- Participants create their **Secret Box 2.0** using the improved program.  
- They test their new program and, once completed, **reset it and put it in full-screen mode**.

---

### **5️⃣ Discussion Round #2**
- Participants compare the **first and second versions** of their Secret Box.  
- The facilitator asks:  
  - *Do you feel your secret is safer now?*  
  - *What would happen if private information is exposed on the internet?*  
  - *How do online games and websites store secrets?*

## 🧐 Debriefing

### **📖 Key Definitions**
- **Computer Program**: A set of instructions written by a human and translated into **binary code (0s and 1s)** that a computer understands.  
- **Hacking**: Exploiting vulnerabilities in a system to access or modify data.  
- **Security Flaws & Vulnerabilities**: Weaknesses in a program that can be exploited by an attacker.

---

### **🔍 Key Takeaways**
- When you store something on a computer, **a program** (written by humans) keeps it.  
- Humans make **errors in their programs**, which can create **security vulnerabilities**.  
- These **vulnerabilities can be exploited** by others to steal or modify your data.  
- **Sensitive information stored on a computer can be stolen.**  
- **Always be cautious about what you share or write on a computer.**  
- **Anyone can be a victim of hacking, so protecting your data is crucial.**
