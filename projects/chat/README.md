### 🏗️ Activity Flow

#### **1️⃣ Energizer: Icebreaker Introduction**
- Participants **face each other** in pairs.
- Each participant **introduces themselves** (first name, age, etc.).
- Each participant creates a **name tag** with their name displayed for others to see.

---

#### **2️⃣ Fabrication: Setting Up the Chat System**
- The **facilitator launches the chat server (MQTT)**.
- Participants **build the chat window program**.
- Each participant enters **their first name** (same as on their name tag) in the **username field**.
- They start the program and begin **chatting with each other**.

##### **💬 Trust Building Phase**
- The facilitator **allows the participants to chat freely** to build **trust and familiarity**.
- After some time, the facilitator **impersonates some participants** by sending messages **using their names**.
  - These messages should contain **information that triggers strong reactions**.
  - The goal is to **create confusion** until participants **realize they did not send those messages**.

##### **🛑 Facilitator's Role in Deception**
- The facilitator reinforces **trust in the system** by saying things like:
  - 🖥️ *"The message appears on everyone's screen, so it must have come from you. The computer cannot lie!"*

- After a while, the facilitator **stops the experiment** and **reveals the deception**.
